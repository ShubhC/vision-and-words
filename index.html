Hello and welcome to this blog. The posts that follow are a collection of notes if you'd like to call them that. They are a way for me to internalize and understand ideas better, and I hope they are useful to you too.


_‘By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.’_ **–Confucius**
