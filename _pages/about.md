Hey there! I'm a Computer Vision and Machine Learning research engineer by day. I'm very interested in areas such as Object tracking, Computational Photography, 3D Reconstruction and Interaction (AR/VR). In my free time you can find me photographing landscapes or sitting my by computer trying to figure out Kaggle :)
